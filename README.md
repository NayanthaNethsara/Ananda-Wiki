# Ananda-Wiki
Ananda Wiki is a website that spreads information about the societies among the students in Ananda College. The main target of these extra-curricular activities is to create closer interaction between the students. By this project, students will start to join the extra- curricular activities and will not be wasting time searching for the society that they are interested in. This will automatically strengthen the societies in our school.   In this website, we are also planning to give information about monthly events in all the societies and this project will definitely help students and societies very much. We are hopeful and believe that Ananda College will produce many more great students in the future.
